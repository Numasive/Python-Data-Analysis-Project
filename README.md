Starting in 2008, every year Forbes Magazine publishes a list of America's best colleges. When it comes to the question everyone seems to be asking, â€œIs college worth it? this published list of colleges comes handy to take a decision based on student's requirement or desire.

The mission of the college ranking by Forbes Magazine is to conduct an annual review of the undergraduate institutions that deliver the top academics, best experiences, career success and lowest debt. Whether a school is in the Top 10 or near the bottom of the list, the 650 colleges are the best in the country.

For most families, choosing a four-year college is one of the biggest and most expensive decisions they can make. For students, this time of their life may layout their future plans. So choose carefully.
